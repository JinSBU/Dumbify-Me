# JDA (Java Discord API)
JDA strives to provide a clean and full wrapping of the Discord REST api and its Websocket-Events for Java.

## JDA 3.x
JDA will be continued with version 3.x and will support Bot-features (for bot-accounts) and Client-features (for user-accounts).
_Please see the [Discord docs](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/reference) for more information about bot accounts._

## UserBots and SelfBots

Discord is currently prohibiting creation and usage of automated client accounts (AccountType.CLIENT).
We however still have support to login with these accounts due to legacy support. That does not mean it is allowed or
welcome to use.
Note that JDA is not a good tool to build a custom discord client as it loads all servers/guilds on startup unlike
a client which does this via lazy loading instead.
If you need a bot, use a bot account from the [Application Dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications).

[Read More](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-)

## Creating the JDA Object

Creating the JDA Object is done via the JDABuilder class. After setting the token and other options via setters,
the JDA Object is then created by calling the `build()` method. When `build()` returns,
JDA might not have finished starting up. However, you can use `awaitReady()`
on the JDA object to ensure that the entire cache is loaded before proceeding.
Note that this method is blocking and will cause the thread to sleep until startup has completed.

**Example**:

```java
JDA jda = new JDABuilder("token").build();
```

**Note**: By default this will use the `AccountType.BOT` as that is the recommended type of account.
You can change this to use `AccountType.CLIENT`, however you will be risking account termination.
Use `new JDABuilder(AccountType)` to change to a different account type.

#### Examples:

**Using EventListener**:

```java
public class ReadyListener implements EventListener
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
            throws LoginException, InterruptedException
    {
        // Note: It is important to register your ReadyListener before building
        JDA jda = new JDABuilder("token")
            .addEventListener(new ReadyListener())
            .build();

        // optionally block until JDA is ready
        jda.awaitReady();
    }

    @Override
    public void onEvent(Event event)
    {
        if (event instanceof ReadyEvent)
            System.out.println("API is ready!");
    }
}
```

**Using ListenerAdapter**:

```java
public class MessageListener extends ListenerAdapter
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
            throws LoginException
    {
        JDA jda = new JDABuilder("token").build();
        jda.addEventListener(new MessageListener());
    }

    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(MessageReceivedEvent event)
    {
        if (event.isFromType(ChannelType.PRIVATE))
        {
            System.out.printf("[PM] %s: %s\n", event.getAuthor().getName(),
                                    event.getMessage().getContentDisplay());
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.printf("[%s][%s] %s: %s\n", event.getGuild().getName(),
                        event.getTextChannel().getName(), event.getMember().getEffectiveName(),
                        event.getMessage().getContentDisplay());
        }
    }
}
```

### More Examples
We provide a small set of Examples in the [Example Directory](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/tree/master/src/examples/java).

In addition you can look at the many Discord Bots that were implemented using JDA:
- [Yui](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/Yui)
- [Vortex](https://github.com/jagrosh/Vortex)
- [FredBoat](https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat)

[And many more!](https://github.com/search?q=JDA+discord+bot&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93)

> **Note**: In these examples we override methods from the inheriting class `ListenerAdapter`.<br>
> The usage of the `@Override` annotation is recommended to validate methods.

## Sharding a Bot

Discord allows Bot-accounts to share load across sessions by limiting them to a fraction of the total connected Guilds/Servers of the bot.
<br>This can be done using **sharding** which will limit JDA to only a certain amount of Guilds/Servers including events and entities.
Sharding will limit the amount of Guilds/Channels/Users visible to the JDA session so it is recommended to have some kind of elevated management to
access information of other shards.

To use sharding in JDA you will need to use `JDABuilder.useSharding(int shardId, int shardTotal)`. The **shardId** is 0-based which means the first shard
has the ID 0. The **shardTotal** is the total amount of shards (not 0-based) which can be seen similar to the length of an array, the last shard has the ID of
`shardTotal - 1`.

The [`SessionController`](http://home.dv8tion.net:8080/job/JDA/javadoc/net/dv8tion/jda/core/utils/SessionController.html) is a tool of the JDABuilder
that allows to control state and behaviour between shards (sessions). When using multiple builders to build shards you have to create one instance
of this controller and add the same instance to each builder: `builder.setSessionController(controller)`

Since version **3.4.0** JDA provides a `ShardManager` which automates this building process.

### Example Sharding - Using JDABuilder

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
{
    JDABuilder shardBuilder = new JDABuilder(args[0]);
    //register your listeners here using shardBuilder.addEventListener(...)
    shardBuilder.addEventListener(new MessageListener());
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        shardBuilder.useSharding(i, 10)
                    .build();
    }
}
```

> When the `useSharding` method is invoked for the first time, the builder automatically sets a SessionController internally (if none is present)

### Example Sharding - Using DefaultShardManager
```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
{
    DefaultShardManagerBuilder builder = new DefaultShardManagerBuilder();
    builder.setToken(args[0]);
    builder.addEventListener(new MessageListener());
    builder.build();
}
```

```

**Gradle without Audio**
```gradle

    compile ('net.dv8tion:JDA:VERSION') {
        exclude module: 'opus-java'
    }
}
```

The builds are distributed using JCenter through Bintray [JDA JCenter Bintray](https://bintray.com/dv8fromtheworld/maven/JDA/)

If you do not need any opus de-/encoding done by JDA (voice receive/send with PCM) you can exclude `opus-java` entirely.
This can be done if you only send audio with an `AudioSendHandler` which only sends opus (`isOpus() = true`). (See [lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer))

If you want to use a custom opus library you can provide the absolute path to `OpusLibrary.loadFrom(String)` before using
the audio api of JDA. This works without `opus-java-natives` as it only requires `opus-java-api`.
<br>_For this setup you should only exclude `opus-java-natives` as `opus-java-api` is a requirement for en-/decoding._

See [opus-java](https://github.com/discord-java/opus-java)

### Logging Framework - SLF4J
JDA is using [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) to log its messages.

That means you should add some SLF4J implementation to your build path in addition to JDA.
If no implementation is found, following message will be printed to the console on startup:
```
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
```

JDA currently provides a fallback Logger in case that no SLF4J implementation is present.
We strongly recommend to use one though, as that can improve speed and allows you to customize the Logger as well as log to files

The most popular implementations are [Log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) and [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/)

### Annotations

We use a number of annotations to indicate future plans for implemented functionality such as new features of
the Discord API.

- [Incubating](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/blob/development/src/main/java/net/dv8tion/jda/annotations/Incubating.java)
    <br>This annotation is used to indicate that functionality may change in the future. Often used when a new feature is added.
- [ReplaceWith](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/blob/development/src/main/java/net/dv8tion/jda/annotations/ReplaceWith.java)
    <br>Paired with `@Deprecated` this is used to inform you how the new code-fragment is supposed to look once the hereby annotated functionality is removed.
- [ForRemoval](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/blob/development/src/main/java/net/dv8tion/jda/annotations/ForRemoval.java)
    <br>Paired with `@Deprecated` this indicates that we plan to entirely remove the hereby annotated functionality in the future.
- [DeprecatedSince](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/blob/development/src/main/java/net/dv8tion/jda/annotations/DeprecatedSince.java)
    <br>Paired with `@Deprecated` this specifies when a feature was marked as deprecated.

## Third Party Recommendations

### [LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer)

Created and maintained by [sedmelluq](https://github.com/sedmelluq)
<br>LavaPlayer is the most popular library used by Music Bots created in Java.
It is highly compatible with JDA and Discord4J and allows to play audio from
Youtube, Soundcloud, Twitch, Bandcamp and [more providers](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer#supported-formats).
<br>The library can easily be expanded to more services by implementing your own AudioSourceManager and registering it.

It is recommended to read the [Usage](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer#usage) section of LavaPlayer
to understand a proper implementation.
<br>Sedmelluq provided a demo in his repository which presents an example implementation for JDA:
https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer/tree/master/demo-jda


### [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities)

Created and maintained by [jagrosh](https://github.com/jagrosh).
<br>JDA-Utilities provides a Command-Extension and several utilities to make using JDA very simple.

Features include:
- Paginated Message using Reactions
- EventWaiter allowing to wait for a response and other events

### [JDAction](https://github.com/sedmelluq/jdaction)

Created and maintained by [sedmelluq](https://github.com/sedmelluq)
<br>JDAction is a [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) plugin which makes sure that the return values of all methods which return a RestAction are used.
Since it is a common mistake to forget to `.queue()`/`.complete()`/`.submit()` RestActions,
and it is often only discovered after noticing that something doesn't work,
this plugin will help catch those cases quickly as it will cause a build failure in such case.

More info about RestAction: [Wiki](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/wiki/7\)-Using-RestAction)

## Contributing to JDA
If you want to contribute to JDA, make sure to base your branch off of our **development** branch (or a feature-branch)
and create your PR into that **same** branch. **We will be rejecting any PRs between branches or into release branches!**

It is also highly recommended to get in touch with the Devs before opening Pull Requests (either through an issue or the Discord servers mentioned above).<br>
It is very possible that your change might already be in development or you missed something.

More information can be found at the wiki page [Contributing](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/wiki/5\)-Contributing)

### Deprecation Policy

When a feature is introduced to replace or enhance existing functionality we might deprecate old functionality.

A deprecated method/class usually has a replacement mentioned in its documentation which should be switched to. Deprecated
functionality might or might not exist in the next minor release. (Hint: The minor version is the `MM` of `XX.MM.RR_BB` in our version format)

It is possible that some features are deprecated without replacement, in this case the functionality is no longer supported by either the JDA structure
due to fundamental changes (for example automation of a feature) or due to discord API changes that cause it to be removed.

We highly recommend to discontinue usage of deprecated functionality and update by going through each minor release instead of jumping.
For instance, when updating from version 3.3.0 to version 3.5.1 you should do the following:

- Update to `3.4.RR_BB` and check for deprecation, replace
- Update to `3.5.1_BB` and check for deprecation, replace

The `BB` indicates the build number specified in the release details.

The `RR` in version `3.4.RR` should be replaced by the latest version that was published for `3.4`, you can find out which the latest
version was by looking at the [release page](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/releases)
