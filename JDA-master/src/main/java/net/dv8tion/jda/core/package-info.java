/**
 * The core JDA features that are both available for
 * BOT and CLIENT applications.
 *
 * <p>This package contains information about the JDA version used by this library.
 * See {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.JDAInfo JDAInfo}!
 *
 * <p>It includes enums that can be found at various locations throughout {@link net.dv8tion.jda} not only the core package!
 *
 * <p>To build a JDA instance you
 * would use the {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.JDABuilder JDABuilder} with a specified {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.AccountType AccountType}
 * to differ between a bot and a client account. Client accounts are commonly referenced as User accounts due to them being used by
 * the official Discord Client.
 * <br>It is recommended to <b>not automate</b> accounts from AccountType {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.AccountType#CLIENT CLIENT}!
 *
 * <p>In addition this package included helpful builders for message sending
 * such as:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.MessageBuilder MessageBuilder}
 *     <br>Used to build a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.Message Message} which can be used to
 *         send a message to a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.MessageChannel MessageChannel} together with
 *         an {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.MessageEmbed MessageEmbed} and Text-To-Speech!</li>
 *
 *     <li>{@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.EmbedBuilder EmbedBuilder}
 *     <br>Used to build a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.MessageEmbed MessageEmbed}
 *         which can then be used in the message sending process (see above)</li>
 * </ul>
