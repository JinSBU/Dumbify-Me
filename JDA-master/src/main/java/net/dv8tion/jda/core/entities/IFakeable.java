/**
 * Marks a fakeable entity.
 * <br>A fake entity ({@link #isFake()} is true) is an entity which is not directly related to this instance of JDA or
 * this JDA shard.
 * <br>An example would be a fake {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.User User}.
 * <br>A fake user can occur when sharding. Discord only sends private messages to Shard 0. If a User which is connected
 * to Guilds on shard 1 sends a private message to the logged in account, it is received on Shard 0. However, if Shard 0
 * does not know about the User due to not having a Guild connection with them, it will use the information provided in
 * the MESSAGE_CREATE event to create a temporary fake user.
 * In this case, the associated {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.PrivateChannel PrivateChannel} is also fake!
 *
 * <p>Another example would be a fake {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.Emote Emote}. If a user sends a message containing
 * an Emote from a {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.Guild Guild} that the currently logged in account is not a part of,
 * JDA will construct a fake {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.Emote Emote} object for it.
